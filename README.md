# ResoCharge: Ambient RF Energy Harvesting System

> *"If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."* — Nikola Tesla

## About the Name

**ResoCharge** combines "Resonance" and "Charge" - reflecting the core principle of resonant frequency matching in Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting. The name honors Nikola Tesla's pioneering work in resonant inductive coupling while emphasizing our focus on ambient energy capture through multi-band resonant rectenna systems.

## Project Vision

Harvest omnipresent electromagnetic energy from ambient RF sources (WiFi, cellular networks, radio broadcasts, TV signals) to create perpetual power sources for ultra-low-power devices. This project explores the feasibility of Tesla's wireless power transmission vision, adapted for the modern wireless world.

## Key Findings

## What Works (Proven)

- Physics is sound: RF energy can be harvested from ambient sources
- Technology exists: Rectenna technology is mature (since 1960s)
- Multi-band helps: Harvesting multiple frequencies increases power
- Perfect for IoT: Ultra-low-power sensors can run indefinitely

## The Challenge

Power Density Gap:
- iPhone needs: 5-15 W for charging
- Typical ambient RF: 10-100 μW/m² available
- Best case harvest: 1-130 μW realistic
- Gap: ~100,000× too low for smartphone charging
