# Quick Reference: RF Energy Harvesting

## Key Formulas

### Energy-Frequency Relationship
```
E = h × f
Where:
 E = Energy per photon (Joules)
 h = Planck's constant (6.626 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)
 f = Frequency (Hz)
```

### Wavelength
```
λ = c / f
Where:
 λ = Wavelength (meters)
 c = Speed of light (3 × 10⁸ m/s)
 f = Frequency (Hz)
```

### Antenna Length (Dipole)
```
L = λ / 2 = c / (2f)

Examples:
 FM 100 MHz: L = 1.5 m
 WiFi 2.4 GHz: L = 6.25 cm
 5G 3.5 GHz: L = 4.29 cm
```

### Power Density
```
S = P / (4πr²)
Where:
 S = Power density (W/m²)
 P = Transmitter power (W)
 r = Distance (m)
```

### Harvested Power
```
P_harvested = S × A × η_total
Where:
 S = Power density (W/m²)
 A = Antenna effective area (m²)
 η_total = Total system efficiency
```

### System Efficiency
```
η_total = η_antenna × η_matching × η_rectifier × η_filter

Typical values:
 η_antenna = 0.75-0.85
 η_matching = 0.85-0.95
 η_rectifier = 0.30-0.70 (depends on power level)
 η_filter = 0.90-0.95
 η_total ≈ 0.25-0.45 (25-45%)
```

### Rectifier Efficiency vs Power
```
Low power (<10 μW): 10-25%
Moderate (10-100 μW): 30-45%
Good (100-1000 μW): 45-60%
High (>1000 μW): 60-75%
```

## Quick Calculations

### Urban Apartment (Typical)
```
Power density: 100 μW/m²
Antenna array: 0.1 m² (10cm × 10cm)
System efficiency: 30%

Harvested = 100 × 0.1 × 0.30 = 3 μW

 Can power: Temperature sensor
 Cannot power: iPhone
```

### Near Cell Tower (Optimal)
```
Power density: 600 μW/m²
Antenna array: 0.25 m² (50cm × 50cm)
System efficiency: 40%

Harvested = 600 × 0.25 × 0.40 = 60 μW

 Can power: E-ink display, IoT node
 Can power: LED (burst mode with supercap)
 Cannot power: iPhone charging
```

### Energy Storage Calculation
```
Supercap: 10F at 3.3V
Stored energy = ½CV² = 0.5 × 10 × 3.3² = 54.5 J

If harvesting 60 μW:
 Charge time = 54.5 J / (60×10⁻⁶ W) = 908,333 s = 10.5 days

If load needs 10 mW burst for 1 second:
 Energy = 10 mW × 1s = 10 mJ = 0.01 J
 Bursts available = 54.5 / 0.01 = 5,450 bursts
 Recharge time per burst = 0.01 / (60×10⁻⁶) = 167 seconds
 Burst rate = 1 burst per 3 minutes (sustainable)
```

## Best Practices

### Antenna Design
1. Use PCB antennas for compactness
2. Tune each antenna to center frequency
3. Maximize effective aperture within size constraints
4. Consider antenna array for directionality
5. Isolate antennas to prevent coupling

### Rectifier Design
1. Use Dickson multiplier for low power (4-8 stages)
2. Select Schottky diodes with lowest V_threshold
3. Optimize capacitor values (100 pF - 1 nF typical)
4. Match impedance at each stage
5. Minimize PCB parasitics

### Power Management
1. Use cold-start capable IC (< 400 mV)
2. Implement MPPT for maximum efficiency
3. Use supercapacitor for buffering
4. Protect battery from over/under voltage
5. Monitor harvesting performance

### System Optimization
1. Target strongest frequency bands (cellular, WiFi)
2. Position device near RF sources
3. Use large ground plane
4. Minimize losses in connections
5. Test in real environment (lab ≠ real world)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

 **Expecting too much power** - Ambient RF is weak
 **Ignoring efficiency** - Every stage has losses
 **Single-band only** - Multi-band is essential
 **Poor impedance matching** - Wastes 50%+ power
 **Undersized supercap** - Cannot handle bursts
 **No MPPT** - Leaves 20-40% on table
 **Lab-only testing** - Real world is different
