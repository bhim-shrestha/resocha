## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some exceptions:

```python
# Good
def calculate_harvested_power(power_density: float, area: float, efficiency: float) -> float:
 """
 Calculate harvested power from ambient RF.
 Args:
 power_density: Available power density in μW/m²
 area: Effective antenna area in m²
 efficiency: System efficiency (0.0 to 1.0)
 Returns:
 Harvested power in μW
 """
 return power_density * area * efficiency

# Use type hints
# Docstrings for all functions
# Clear variable names
# Comments for complex logic
```

**Tools we use:**
- `black` for formatting (when available)
- `pylint` for linting
- `mypy` for type checking

### Documentation Style

**IMPORTANT: All documentation must follow professional/academic standards.**

See **[WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md](WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md)** for complete guidelines.

**Quick summary:**
- NO emojis or emoticons (strictly enforced)
- Formal, professional language only
- All technical claims must be cited
- Define acronyms on first use
- Include units in all measurements

**Markdown guidelines:**
- Use clear headers (# ## ###)
- Include code examples
- Add visual elements (tables, diagrams)
- Keep line length reasonable (~80-100 chars)
- **NO EMOJIS** - Maintain professional/academic tone

**Technical writing standards:**
- Use formal, professional language
- Avoid casual expressions and colloquialisms
- Define acronyms on first use (e.g., "Radio Frequency (RF)")
- Include units in all measurements (μW, MHz, m², etc.)
- Show calculations step-by-step with clear notation
- **Always cite sources** - Add references to REFERENCES.md
- Use third person or passive voice for formal documentation
- Prefer "we recommend" over "we think" or "we feel"
- Use "cannot" instead of "can't", "does not" instead of "doesn't"

**Academic writing principles:**
- Present findings objectively without hyperbole
- Use hedging language appropriately ("may", "suggests", "indicates")
- Support all claims with data or citations
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout
- Use proper scientific notation and symbols

### Hardware Design

**File formats:**
- **Schematics:** KiCad (preferred), Altium, Eagle
- **PCB:** Gerber files + source files
- **3D Models:** STL, STEP
- **Documentation:** PDF exports + source

**Naming:**
```
resocharge_v1.0_schematic.kicad_sch
resocharge_v1.0_pcb.kicad_pcb
resocharge_v1.0_bom.csv
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Simulation Testing

If you modify the simulator:

```python
# Example test (future)
def test_power_calculation():
 """Test basic power calculation"""
 power_density = 100 # μW/m²
 area = 0.1 # m²
 efficiency = 0.3
 expected = 3.0 # μW
 actual = calculate_power(power_density, area, efficiency)
 assert abs(actual - expected) < 0.1
```

### Hardware Testing

If you build hardware:

**Required measurements:**
- Power density at antenna (before rectifier)
- DC output power (after rectifier)
- Efficiency calculation
- Temperature monitoring
- Time-series data (1 hour minimum)

**Please document:**
- Location and environment
- Equipment used (spectrum analyzer, etc.)
- Date and time of testing
- Weather/RF conditions
