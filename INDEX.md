## Main Documentation

### 1⃣ [01_WIRELESS_CHARGING_DEEP_DIVE.md](01_WIRELESS_CHARGING_DEEP_DIVE.md)
**Understanding the Baseline**
- How iPhone Qi wireless charging works
- Electromagnetic induction principles (Faraday's Law)
- Frequency: ~127.7 kHz, Power: 5-15W
- Why it only works at close range (inverse cube law)
- Near-field vs far-field electromagnetic energy
- Critical insight: Need far-field (radio frequency) for distance

**Key Takeaway:** Near-field induction (Qi) ≠ far-field radiation (RF harvesting)

---

### 2⃣ [02_FREQUENCY_AND_ENERGY_PHYSICS.md](02_FREQUENCY_AND_ENERGY_PHYSICS.md)
**The Physics Foundation**
- Planck-Einstein relation: E = h × f
- Electromagnetic spectrum analysis
- Energy per photon calculations
- Power density vs energy distinction
- Wave-particle duality
- Energy conversion mechanisms

**Key Formulas:**
```
E = h × f (Energy per photon)
P = (E × N) / t (Power from photon flux)
S = E² / η₀ (Power density from field)
```

**Key Takeaway:** Frequency DOES carry energy, but power density is critically low

### 3⃣ [03_AMBIENT_RF_SOURCES_CATALOG.md](03_AMBIENT_RF_SOURCES_CATALOG.md)
**What's Available to Harvest**
- Complete RF source inventory by location
- Power density measurements
- Frequency bands and characteristics
- Time-based and location-based variations

**Power Densities:**
- Urban apartment: 50-150 μW/m²
- Near cell tower: 200-1000 μW/m²
- Shopping mall: 200-500 μW/m²
- Rural area: 5-20 μW/m²

**Best Frequency Bands:**
1. Cellular (700-2600 MHz) 
2. WiFi (2.4, 5 GHz) 
3. 5G (3.5 GHz) 
4. TV UHF (470-806 MHz) 
5. FM Radio (88-108 MHz) 

**Key Takeaway:** Energy IS omnipresent, but power density is micro-watts per square meter

---

### 4⃣ [04_TESLA_WIRELESS_POWER_RESEARCH.md](04_TESLA_WIRELESS_POWER_RESEARCH.md)
**Learning from the Master**
- Tesla's resonant inductive coupling invention
- Wardenclyffe Tower project and vision
- Colorado Springs experiments (1899)
- Modern validation: MIT WiTricity
- What Tesla got right and wrong
- Applying Tesla's principles to RF harvesting

**Tesla's Key Insights:**
1. **Resonance is everything** - Matching frequencies = maximum efficiency
2. **Multiple receivers possible** - One source, many receivers
3. **Environment contains energy** - Just need to tap it
4. **Frequency matters** - Different frequencies for different purposes

**Key Takeaway:** Tesla was right about wireless power - we're just harvesting existing transmissions, not creating new ones

---

### 5⃣ [05_RECTENNA_TECHNOLOGY_DEEP_DIVE.md](05_RECTENNA_TECHNOLOGY_DEEP_DIVE.md)
**How to Convert RF to DC**
- Rectenna (rectifying antenna) principles
- Component analysis: antennas, matching networks, rectifiers
- Multi-band harvesting architectures
- State-of-the-art performance review
- Efficiency analysis at different power levels
- Advanced techniques (MPPT, backscatter, metamaterials)

**System Architecture:**
```
RF Wave → Antenna → Matching → Rectifier → Filter → Storage → Load
 (80% eff) (90% eff) (40% eff) (95% eff)
Total system efficiency: 25-45%
```

**Performance Reality:**
- William C. Brown (1964): 84% efficiency with dedicated microwave beam
- Modern ambient harvesting: 25-45% efficiency, but input power is tiny
- Best commercial: 10-50 μW harvested (Powercast P2110)

**Key Takeaway:** Technology works and is mature - power density is the limitation, not conversion efficiency
